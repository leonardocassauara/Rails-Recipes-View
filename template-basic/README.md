</h1>

This is a simple web application with just two pages: main & new.

The application shows on the screen the list of recipes created by the user, each recipe having the attributes name, ingredients, stars and preparation time (name, ingredients, stars, time_to_make). If there is a recipe created, a button to delete it will appear.

The second tab of the application is a screen that allows the registration of a new recipe, giving the user the freedom to write whatever they want in the (untreated) attribute fields of the new recipe.
